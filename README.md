# Precision Keyboard

Precision Keyboard is a node based synth keyboard with additional utilities, designed for mobile devices - with a focus on phone form-factor and Android.

It also includes features, such as:

* A metronome
* Various ear-training and music theory tutorials that leverage the authored synths
* Built-in text documentation
* Built-in example instruments
* Built-in tutorial document covering node authoring
* Support for MIDI input; allows playing synths from external hardware for both for Android and PC
* Support for MIDI output; allows using the virtual keyboard as a MIDI hardware device

The project was previously on the Google Play store, but its time on the store has since expired, and is now being hosted as open source.

The project is made in Unity.

The application will work on Windows and Android.

# Submodule Libraries

The project uses multiple in-house libraries that are usually hosted as submodules. Except the original repository was lost, and the source code is being hosted from a backup, which has the libraries baked in. 

Hosting the project from the last backup also means the application may not be the most recent version that was hosted on the Google Play store, but is close to feature-parity of that version.

# Support

The project is hosted for demonstration and archival purposes, and is not being actively supported.

# License

The copyright of the project was previously held by Pixel Precision, LLC. The application may still have a few references to that name. REUSE OF THAT BRAND IS PROHIBITED, and any shared application built from this project should remove mention of Pixel Precision, and any of its branding assets.

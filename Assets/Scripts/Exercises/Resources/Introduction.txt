Welcome to Precision Keyboard!

This application is designed to let users explore audio synthesis, have a virtual keyboard, and exercise music theory concepts. Hopefully there's something fun and useful for both beginners and veterans of pianos, music, and synthesizers.

The application is made to run on different form factors, from the desktop to a mobile phone in your pocket. The first peice of advice is to modify the <b>UI Scale</b> slider in the <b>Options</b> tab to adjust the UI to be the most comfortable form for your device type.

It is also recommended that new users read the <b>FAQ</b> notes, as well as the other notes also available in the <b>Options</b> tab.
